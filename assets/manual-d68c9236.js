Further instructions how to interpret them are shown in the tool.",Qo=n(),A=s("h2"),A.textContent="Known limitations",Xo=n(),Ct=s("ul"),Ct.innerHTML="<li><strong>New bridges or links:</strong> You cannot draw new road segments in places where there is no existing infrastructure. It&#39;s impossible to model a new bridge over a canal or through a park. If you intend to create a new off-road route parallel to an existing road, then for now, draw along that road.</li> <li><strong>Junctions:</strong> There is currently no modelling of the effect of junctions or the ability to specify an improvement at a junction. At present it is assumed that a designer will incorporate appropriate junction treatments. We hope to address this in a later phase of work.</li> <li><strong>Bidirectionality</strong>: A simplifying assumption throughout NPW is that all infrastructure is bidirectional. When you draw something along a road, it is assumed that people cycling will be able to travel either direction along it, even when the road is one-way for drivers. NPW does not presently differentiate between two one-way segregated cycle tracks on both sides of the road versus a single segregated bidirectional track on one side of the road.</li> <li><strong>Paths alongside motorways:</strong> Similar to the note above about new bridges or links, there is currently no way to represent a proposed new path alongside an existing motorway, because motorway data is not imported (and thus its attributes cannot be changed) and it is not currently possible to draw on new links.</li> <li><strong>Gradients:</strong> Currently a basic interpretation of land height data is used. This means that where the network does follow the land contours, e.g. some bridges, the gradient will incorrectly show flat sections of network as steep. Similarly, paths alongside waterways could end up with oscillating results due to the resolution of the underlying height readings. For the coherent network, which uses CycleStreets routing, a full-scale implementation of gradients has been used and so that dataset is not been subject to these distortions.</li> <li><strong>Attractive streets:</strong> This experimental layer aims to determine the attractiveness of a street based on its proximity to green space, but the algorithm is currently very simplistic. This uses the Ordnance Survey&#39;s Open Greenspace dataset. If a road center-line is within 10m of any green space polygon (without any filtering), it is considered attractive. We hope in future to create a more comprehensive analysis.</li> <li><strong>Out-of-boundary drawing:</strong> Currently the NPW disallows drawing outside the boundary of settlements. It is recognised that this can cause issues when a boundary line forms a concave shape, and that the edges of this need a route going into another local authority&#39;s boundary. In this scenario, for now, local authority officers should communicate with each other to ensure their collective submissions ensure routes across these areas.</li> <li><strong>Saving work:</strong> Currently work is saved only within your computer&#39;s browser rather than to a web service. This means that if you want to switch to another computer, you need to export the data first, then load it into your other computer&#39;s browser on the project selection screen.</li> <li><strong>Mobile phone compatibility:</strong> No attempt has been made to adapt the layout of the site to work well on phones, as the ability to plan a network would be hard to do efficiently on a small screen. It is assumed at present that transport professionals will be using a desktop computer or a large tablet. However, we have not actively disabled any functionality on smaller devices, and we are using web standards that should be well-supported on any device.</li>",es=n(),j=s("h2"),j.textContent="OpenStreetMap",ts=n(),St=s("p"),St.innerHTML='<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=7/56.514/-3.834">OpenStreetMap</a> (OSM) is a free, editable map of the whole world that is being built by volunteers largely from scratch, together with data provided by companies and governmental organisations and released with an open-content license.',is=n(),Lt=s("p"),Lt.textContent="OSM is widely considered the best available data source for planning of active travel networks, as it contains the most comprehensive network of paths beyond just the street network.",os=n(),Mt=s("p"),Mt.textContent="OSM consists only of objective, factual data (e.g. that a particular street exists in a particular location, with particular attributes such as width, surface, etc.), as distinct from objective data (e.g. that a street is considered nice to ride on by some people).",ss=n(),Pt=s("p"),Pt.textContent="In modelling the world, OSM consists of any real-world feature that physically exists.",ns=n(),Nt=s("p"),Nt.textContent="The OSM data model fundamentally consists of:",as=n(),Wt=s("ul"),Wt.innerHTML="<li>Geometries, which outline the location of each feature, e.g. the shape of the road based on longitude-latitude co-ordinates.
