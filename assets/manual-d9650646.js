This means that where the network does follow the land contours, e.g. some bridges, the gradient will incorrectly show flat sections of network as steep.

We hope in future to create a more comprehensive analysis.</li> <li><strong>Out-of-boundary drawing:</strong> Currently the NPW disallows drawing outside the boundary of settlements. It is recognised that this can cause issues when a boundary line forms a concave shape, and that the edges of this need a route going into another local authority&#39;s boundary. In this scenario, for now, local authority officers should communicate with each other to ensure their collective submissions ensure routes across these areas.</li> <li><strong>Saving work:</strong> Currently work is saved only within your computer&#39;s browser rather than to a web service.
